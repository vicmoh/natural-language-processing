There are two sample programs included in this folder:

   StemmerDemo.java: read a text line-by-line and stem the tokens on each line

   TreeMapDemo.java: read a text line-by-line, filter out irrelevant tokens, and
      update a TreeMap for the relevant tokens to get the total counts for each token type

To build all the programs, simply type "make", and to rebuild, type "make clean" and 
then "make".

Examples for testing the related programs:

    java -cp ../opennlp-tools-1.9.1.jar:. StemmerDemo sample.tokenized > sample.stemmed

    java TreeMapDemo < test.txt
