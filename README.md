# Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing

## General Description:

For many NLP tasks, a document collection often needs to be preprocessed and analyzed in order to know the characteristics of the data set and apply suitable machine learning techniques. As described in the lectures, there can be many steps involved in the process, depending on the tasks to be performed as well.

## How to run:

Typing `make` or `make all` in program directory will 
run default '../assets/samples.txt' file as input. 
It will create the `.class` file to `bin/` folder.
all process output will be on `output/` folder.

The `output/` after process will contain:
* data.splitted
* data.stats
* data.tagged
* data.tokenized
