There are two sample programs included in this folder that show how to use
some of the tools in Apache OpenNLP toolkit:

   SentenceDetectionME.java: split a body of text into a sequence of sentences

   POSTaggingMEDemo.java: associate a sequence of words with their POS tags

   TokenizerMEProbs.java: tokenize text and convert words to their stems 

To build all the programs, simply type "make", and to rebuild, type "make clean" and 
then "make".

Examples for testing the related programs:

    java -cp ../opennlp-tools-1.9.1.jar:. SentenceDetectionME sample.txt > sample.splitted

    java -cp ../opennlp-tools-1.9.1.jar:. POSTaggingMEDem sample.splitted > sample.tagged
 
    java -cp ../opennlp-tools-1.9.1.jar:. TokenizerMEProbs sample.splitted > sample.stemmed
